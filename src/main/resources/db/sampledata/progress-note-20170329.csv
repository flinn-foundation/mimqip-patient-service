54,1,3,2011-03-22 15:06:51,Sample Doctor,"The Ethel and James Flinn Foundation traces its roots three generations back to Elisha Flinn.&nbsp; He was born in 1843 and lived in New York State until coming to Detroit in 1865 to enter the practice of law.&nbsp; Elisha Flinns clients were companies involved in natural resources but he gradually discontinued the practice of law to enter the business of buying and selling pine timber in Michigan.&nbsp; He formed a partnership with his former partner under the name of Robinson and Flinn and when the Michigan pine timber gave out they moved their activities to other states and later to Minnesota.&nbsp; Robinson and Flinn associated with others from Michigan and purchased considerable acreage of pine land in Minnesota.&nbsp; In 1892 iron ore was found on their Minnesota properties and from that time until his death in 1911 Elisha Flinns principal business was iron ore mining in and around Eveleth, Minnesota.&nbsp; He was president of the Lake Superior Iron and Chemical Company, a vice president of old Detroit National Bank and a director of the Wayne County Savings Bank and the Detroit Trust Company.&nbsp; In 1871 he married Samantha Whitwood.&nbsp; Elisha and Samantha lived on Putnam Ave. in Detroit and raised two children James H. and Mary W.<br><br>Elisha Flinns son, James H. Flinn, was born in 1874.&nbsp; He graduated from the University of Michigan Law School.&nbsp; James Flinn devoted most of his business career to managing and supervising the iron ore activities in Minnesota.&nbsp; By 1899 the town of Eveleth and Elisha Flinn and his associates had a dilemma as iron ore had been discovered under the original town of Eveleth.&nbsp; To mine this valuable iron ore supply it would be necessary to move the towns business district five blocks east.&nbsp; James Flinn temporarily relocated to Eveleth to supervise the move.&nbsp; He was responsible for installation of steam hoists which pulled the buildings up the towns main street.&nbsp; Soon one-hundred buildings were moved safely onto the new main street allowing Flinn and his associates to profit from the previously unobtainable ore.<br><br>James Flinn married Ethel Garretson in 1906.&nbsp; Ethel and James raised three children, George, Ethel W. and James H. Jr. first on Seminole in Detroit and then in Grosse Pointe, Michigan.&nbsp; It was Ethel and James who set the course for the Ethel and James Flinn Foundation.&nbsp; They established a number of living and testamentary trusts that provided for distribution of the trust remainders upon termination to a philanthropic organization that would provide for the support of research into the causes and/or research into the treatment of nervous and mental diseases.<br><br>Ethel W. Peggy Flinn with her cousin and her lawyer established the Foundation in 1976.&nbsp; Her intent was to remember her parents, Ethel and James and her brother, James H., Jr. and to consolidate and direct the familys philanthropy toward the purposes already expressed by her parents in their trusts documents; research into the causes and/or research into the treatment of nervous and mental diseases.&nbsp; Peggy graduated from Columbia Presbyterian College of Nursing in New York as a registered nurse and was a volunteer nurse with the Red Cross during World War II.&nbsp; She was particularly interested in children and was a longtime and life member of the Board of Trustees of Childrens Hospital of Michigan.&nbsp; Her life passion was horses.&nbsp; She owned, rode and showed champion horses throughout the country.&nbsp; She was a life member of the American Horseshow Association.&nbsp; She provided initial funding to the foundation during her lifetime and left an endowment to the foundation on her death in 1994.<br><br>Jim Flinn, Jr. attended Princeton and Babson University.&nbsp; He was afflicted with schizophrenia in his early 20s and following the death of his father in 1952 resided for the rest of his adult life at the St. Joseph Mercy Health System in Ann Arbor, Michigan.&nbsp; The caregivers at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital provided a unique, close, caring and supportive environment that contributed to Jims long life and to his good quality of life.&nbsp; Jims interests were many and varied; reading, history, University of Michigan football, movies, gardening, bike riding and traveling.&nbsp; Helping the disadvantaged and philanthropy were of special interest to him.&nbsp; In later years he made substantial contributions to the foundation and to charities generally.&nbsp; Upon Jims death all of the Flinns interests were transferred to the foundation leaving as a legacy a philanthropic foundation that will improve the lives of those with mental illness.<br>"

She sat quietly while he paced around the room and explained that he was feeling great and didn&#39;t think he needed to see anyone.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steve explained that he had been depressed a few weeks ago, but now felt much better. He immediately went on to tell the social worker about some of the unique business plans he was developing,&nbsp; including one for a online custom bakery. He was convinced that this would revolutionize the baking industry.&nbsp; &#34;I have a special talent for business innovations like this.&#34;, he added.&nbsp; &#34;Everyone I talk to agrees with me.&nbsp; They haven&#39;t seen anything like it before.&#34;&nbsp; The social worker reported that it was difficult to interrupt the rapid flow of Steve&#39;s speech.&nbsp; After several tries she was finally able to ask him about some of the details of his business plan, such as how the customers would get the baked goods. Steve responded by becoming increasingly irritated. &#34;You&#39;re just a skeptic like my wife,&#34; he yelled. &#34; I can&#39;t tell you any of the details because there are people around who will try to steal them.&#34;&nbsp; Steve talked rapidly during the interview, jumping from one topic to another, often with no apparent logical connections between the topics. As he spoke he paced around the room, periodically sitting in the chair next to his wife, and then jumping up to pace some more.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few minutes, Steve&#39;s wife gently asked her husband to sit down so she could talk to the social worker.&nbsp; He appeared irritated at her request, but finally sat down. She reported that the couple had been married for 6 years.&nbsp; During that time Steve had had periodic changes in his mood.&nbsp; Sometimes he would be depressed for several weeks and then he would snap out of it and seem normal for a while.&nbsp; During one of these episodes Steve&#39;s primary care provider prescribed some antidepressant medication for him, but Steve stopped taking the medication after a few weeks when his depression ended. This time, when the depression ended, he had a brief period of normal mood and then became more and more excited about some of his business plans.&nbsp; He kept saying that everything was going to be great now.&nbsp; He had a great deal of energy and rarely slept more than 2 or 3 hours a night.&nbsp; She reported that Steve talked incessantly about his brilliant new ideas and how they would make him a fortune.&nbsp; He withdrew a significant amount of money from their savings to invest in the projects.&nbsp; The money disappeared and she has no idea where it went.&nbsp; When she asked Steve about the money he began yelling at her and accused her of doubting him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She thought that he would settle down in a few days, but, instead, his thinking became more and more optimistic and unrealistic.&nbsp; He was convinced that they would soon be rich from his Internet businesses.&nbsp; Sometimes she could not understand what he was talking about.&nbsp; Finally, she convinced him to come to the outpatient clinic by telling him that one of the doctors from the clinic had called to inquire about one of Steve&#39;s projects and wanted to meet him.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The social worker who interviewed Steve made a preliminary DSM diagnosis of bipolar disorder, manic.&nbsp; She administered the Brief Bipolar Disorder Symptom Scale (BDSS) and the Global Rating Scales and referred Steve to another clinician in the office for treatment. <br><br>"
